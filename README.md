## Move Away

move-away it app for moving large files to another location (maybe another drive) and symlink them to still have a access to them on old location. 

nodejs and is for cli. 
Reactjs is GUI for toggling moved files to STORAGE.
Electronjs is mainly a bridge between BE and FE.

Mostly I'm using it for moving games from my smaller ssd to bigger hdd. I like to keep them on ssd, but when I don't play them, I can save space on ssd without uninstalling.
