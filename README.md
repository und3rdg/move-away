## Move Away

move-away is an app for relocating large files into STORAGE location (maybe another drive). After that symlink is created, so access to them on old location is not bracken. 

nodejs and is for cli for adding them to STORAGE 
Reactjs is GUI for toggling moved files between STORAGE and ORIG.
Electronjs is a bridge between BE and FE.

Mostly I'm using it for moving games from my smaller ssd to bigger hdd. I like to keep them on ssd, but when I don't play them, I can save space on ssd without uninstalling.
