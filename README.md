## Move files away

move-away is an app for relocating large files into STORAGE location (maybe another hard/ssh drive). After relocating, symlink is created, so system still can access them on old location.


## How it's made
nodejs and is for cli for adding them to STORAGE 

Reactjs is GUI for toggling moved files between STORAGE and ORIG back and forward.

Electronjs is a bridge between BE and FE.


## For what I'm using it
I'm using it mostly for moving games between smaller ssd and bigger hdd. I like to run them from ssd, but when I don't use them often, I can save space on ssd without messing around in steam/playonlinux/lutris or in whatever I'm using to run them.
